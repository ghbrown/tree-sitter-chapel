**Current bugs**:
- rat's nest of precendences I don't understand (mainly how to choose them
  intelligently)

====> solution: write tests that slightly push
                complications and boundaries, turn binary operators back on

**Priority of implementation**:
- write tests for existing rules
  - more variable declaration tests
    - add types
    - add initialization expression
  - literal tests
    - integers
    - reals
- binary expression
- procedures
- call-expression
- array-literal
